        HTML elements are displayed in browsers in one of two ways: Block and Inline

        Block elements: these elements always appear on a new line
            e.g: <h1> and <p> elements

            If the <img> element is followed by a block elevel element, then the block level element will sit on a new line after the images
        
        Inline elements: these elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line
            e.g: <b>, <em>, and <img> elements.

            If the <img> element is inside a block level element, any text or other inline elements will flow around the image

    <h2>Placing an Image Before a Paragraph</h2>
    <!--
        Placing an image before a paragraph will make the paragraph start on a new line after the image

    <img src="images/colognes.jpg" alt="Colognes" width="300" height="275" />
    <p>These colognes are some of the best ones to come out in 2016. I bought these from the Tanger Outlet at a store <br />
        called Perfumania. I thought the store itself was really small and didn't have much of a selection but they were <br />
        organized which made the shopping experience great. I found what I wanted in just a few minutes and then shopped <br />
        the non-brand-name colognes and found one that I really liked. It was cheaper than the brand-name ones to begin <br />
        with and they ended up taking off another 25% from its price because I also bought 2 name-brand ones.

    <h2>Placing an Image in the Middle of a Paragraph</h2>
    <!--
        Placing an image in the middle of a paragraph will cause the text to be aligned with the bottom of the image and
        the image will cause the text on the line above to be pushed up based on the height of the image
