    <h1>Button</h1>

    <!--
        The button element was introduced to allow users more controls over how their
        buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button. This
        means that you can combine text and image between the opening <button> tag
        and closing </button> tag.

            type: "hidden" means that the control is not shown on the page.
