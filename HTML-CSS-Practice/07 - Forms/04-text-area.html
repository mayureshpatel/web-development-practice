    <h1>Text Area</h1>

    <!--
        The <textarea> element is used to create a multi-line text input. Unline other input elements
        this is not an empty element. It should have opening and closing tags.

        Any text that appears between the opening <textarea> and the the closing </textarea> tage will
        appear in the box when the page loads

        If the text between the tags is not deleted by the user, then the text will get sent to the server
        along with whatever the user has typed.

        cols and rows is the older way of giving the textarea control a width and height. The new way
        uses CSS and these attributes should not be used.
