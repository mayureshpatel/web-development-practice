    <h1>Multiple Select Box</h1>

    <!--
        A multiple select box allows users to select zero or more options from the list.

            size: You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one
            option by adding the size attribute. Its value should be the number of options
            you want to show at once. Browser support is not accross the board, so this
            should be tested on all browsers when being used.

            multiple: You should add this attribute with a value of "multiple" when you want
            to create a multiple select box. It is also a good idea to let users know that
            they can select more than one option by holding down the CRTL/Command button.

            while selecting different options.)
