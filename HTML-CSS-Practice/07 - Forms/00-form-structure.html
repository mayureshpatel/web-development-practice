    <h1>Form Structure</h1>

    <!--
        Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute.

            action: this attribute is required for all forms. Its value is the URl for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
            method: forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
                get: the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. the get method is ideal for:
                    short forms, when you are just retrieving data from the web server
                
                post: the values from the form are sent in what is known as HTTP headers. you should use the post method if your form:
                    allows users to upload a file, is very long, contains sensitive data, adds information to, or deletes information from, a databse
                
                Note: if the method attribute is not used, the default method is get
            id: the value of the id attribute is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page

    <form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
        <p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
