    <h1>Submit Button</h1>

    <!--
        The submit button is used to send a form to the server.

            type: this attribute should be "submit" when the button is meant to submit the form
            to the server.

            value: this attribute is used to control the text that shows up on the button itself.
            It is good practice to describe what clicking the button will do, also the default value
            on some browsers is "submit query", which may not be appropriate.
