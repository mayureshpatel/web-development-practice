    <h1>Search Input</h1>

    <!--
        If you want to create a single line text box for search queries,
        HTML5 provides a special type of input for that purpose.

        Attributes:

            type: "search" - If you want to create a single line text box for serach
            queries, "search" will do just that. Older browsers will treat this as
            a normal text box. New broswers will add some extra functionality such as
            adding a cross to clear the text box.

            placeholder: On any text input, you can also use this attribute whose value
            is text that will be shown in the text box until the user click that area.
            Older browsers will just ignore this.
