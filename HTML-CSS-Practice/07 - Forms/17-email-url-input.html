    <h1>Email and URL Input</h1>

    <!--
        HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to enter email
        addresses and URLs. Browsers that don't support these will just
        treat them as regular text boxes.

        Attributes:

            type: "email" - If you ask for an email address, you can use the
            email input. HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided
            information in the correct format of an email address.

            type: "url" - If you want the user to enter a URL, you can use the
            url input. HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided
            information in the format of a URL.
