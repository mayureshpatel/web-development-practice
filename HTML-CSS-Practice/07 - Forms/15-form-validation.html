    <h1>Form Validation</h1>

    <!--
        Form validation has traditionally been performed using Javascript. But HTML5
        is introducing validation and leaving the work to the browser.

        Validation helps ensure the user enters information in a form that the server
        will be able to understand when the form is submitted. Validating the contents
        of the form before it is sent to the server the helps:

            - Reduce the amount of work the server has to do
            - Enables user to see if there are problems with the form
                faster than if validation were performed on the server

        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" name="username" required="required" />
        <br />

        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" required="required" />

        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
