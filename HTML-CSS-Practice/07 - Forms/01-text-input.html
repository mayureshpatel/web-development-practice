    <h1>Text Input</h1>

    <!--
        The <input> element is used to create several differnt form controls. The value of the type
        attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.

            type: when the type attribute is set to "text", it creates a single-line text input
            
            name: when users enters information into a form, the server needs to know which form control
            each piece of data was entered into. Therefore, each form controls requires a name attribute.
            The value fo this attribute identifies the form controls and is sent along with the information
            they enter to the server.
            
            size: Should not be used on new forms. It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the
            the text input, measured in the number of characters seen. In new forms, CSS should be used to
            control the width of form elements.
            
            maxlength: You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter
            into the text field. Its value is the number of characters they may enter.
