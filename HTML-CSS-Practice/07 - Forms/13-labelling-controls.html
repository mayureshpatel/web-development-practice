    <h1>Labelling Form Controls</h1>

    <!--
        Each form controls should have its own <label> element as this makes the form
        accessible to vision-impaired users. The <label> element can be used in two ways:
            
            1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input.
            2. Be kept seperate form the form controls and use the for attribute to indicate
            which form control it is a label for.

        Attributes:

            for: this attribute states which form control the label belongs to. The value of the id
            attribute uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page. The value
            of the for attribute matches that of the id attribute on the form control it is labelling.

        Positioning:

            As a rule of thumb, these are the best places to place labels on form controls:

                Above or the the left:
                    text inputs
                    text areas
                    select boxes
                    file uploads

                To the right:
                    individual checkboxes
                    individual radio buttons
    -->
    <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
        <label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" /></label>

        <br />
        Gender:

        <input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f" />
        <label for="female">Female</label>

        <input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" value="m" />
        <label for="male">Male</label>
    </form>
