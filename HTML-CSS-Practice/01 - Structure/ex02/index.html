    <!-- Semnatic markups should be used to describe the content of your web pages more accurately rather than
         changing the way that your text looks. The main reason to use these elements is so that other programs,
         such as screen readers or search engines, can use this extra information.
    -->
    
    <h2>Strong Tag</h2>
    <!-- The <strong> tage indicates that the content has strong importance, but by default, browsers will show the contents of <strong> in bold -->
    <p><strong>Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in this area.</p>

    <h2>Em Tag</h2>
    <!-- The <em> tag indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of <em> in italic -->
    <p>I <em>think</em> Ivy was the first</p>
    <p>I think <em>Ivy</em> was the first</p>

    <!-- There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations: <blockquote> and <q>
         
         The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up and entire paragraph. Browsers will indent <blockquote> elements.
        
         The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a <p> element. Browsers put quotes around the text inside the <q> element.
             
         The cite attribute can be used to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information.
    -->
    <h2>Quotations Tag</h2>
    <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh">
        <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p>

    <!-- You can use abbreviations or acronyms in your markup and have them spell out what they mean when you hover over them.
         HTML5 uses the <abbr> tag with a title attribute that specifies what the abbreviation means
         HTML4 also used the <acronym> tag with the title attribute. However, it is not commonly used anymore.
    -->
    <h2>Abbreviations Tag</h2>
    <p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.</p>
    <p><acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> does some crazy space stuff</p>

    <!-- When you are referenceing a piece of work, the <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
        <cite> should not be used for a person's name.
        Browsers will render the content of a <cite> element in italics.

        <dfn> can be used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. Some browsers show the content of <dfn> in italics.
    -->
    <h2>Citations and Definitions Tags</h2>
    <p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen
        Hawking has sold over ten million copies
        worldwide.
    </p>
    
    <p>A <dfn>Black Hole</dfn> is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>

    <!--
        The <address> element can be used to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contains a physical
        address, phone number, or email address. The <address> element is generally displayed in italics.
    -->
    <h2>Address Tag</h2>
    <address>
        <p><a href="mailto:mayureshpatel@yahoo.com">mayureshpatel@yahoo.com</a></p>
        <p>100 My Street, Dublin, IR</p>
    </address>

    <!--
        The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document
        The <del> element can be used to show content that has been deleted from a document

        The content of a <ins> element is usually underlined, whereas the content of a <del>
        element usually has a line through it.

        The <s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).

        Visually, the content of a <s> element will usually be displayed with a line through it.
    -->
    <h2>Inserted and Deleted Text Tags</h2>
    <p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea she had ever had.</p>
