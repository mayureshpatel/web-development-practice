        Links are created using the <a> element.

            <a href="https://www.artofmanlieness.com/">AOM</a>

        Links have a href attribute that points to the page you want to navigate to.
        The text between the opening and closing tags is the text that users will see and be able to click on.

        Browsers, by default, will show links in blue with an underline
