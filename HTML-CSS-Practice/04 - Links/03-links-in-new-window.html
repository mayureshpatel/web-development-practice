    <h2>Opening A Link in a New Window</h2>

    <!-- 
        If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag.
        The value of the attribute should be "_blank". This is commonly used when you want a link on your
        site to point to another website. You also want to let users know that clicking on the link will open up a new window.
