    <h2>Linking to other pages on the same site</h2>

    <!--
        When linking to other pages on the same site, you don't have to give the absolute url.
        You can use a shorthand known as a relative url.

        If all the pages are in the same folder, then the value of the href is just the name of
        the file.

        Otherwise, if the pages are in different folders, you will need to indicate which folder
        it is in by "walking" to the that folder.

            Walking to a file:

                Example Structure:
                    examplearts
                        index.html
                        images
                            logo.gif
                        movies
                            cinema
                                index.html
                                listings.html
                                reviews.html
                            dvd
                                index.html
                                reviews.html
                                listings.html
                        music
                            index.html
                            listings.html
                            reviews.html
                        theater
                            index.html
                            listings.html
                            reviews.html

                1) If you are currently in examplearts/movies/index.html and you want to get to music/index.html
                    ../../../music/index.html     -> you have to walk backwards using ../ up to the examplearts folder to go into the music folder
