    <h1>Long Tables</h1>

    <!--
        There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows. These elements help people who use screen readers and also allow you to style these sections in a different manner than the rest of the table.

        <thead> = Table Header
            The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element

        <tbody> = Table Body
            The body should sit inside the <tbody> element

        <tfoot> = Table Footer
            The footer belogns inside the <tfoot> element
        
        Note: By default, browsers rarely treat the content of these element any differently than other elements however, designers often use CSS styles to change their appearance.
