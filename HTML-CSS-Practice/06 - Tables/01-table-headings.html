    <h1>Table Headings</h1>

    <!--
        The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.
            <th> = table heading
                Using <th> elements for heading helps people who use screen readers, improves the ability for search engines to
                index your pages, and also enables you to control the appearance of tables better.

        Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or <th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise
        the table will not render correctly.

        Note: Browsers usually display the content of a <th> element in bold and in the middle of the cell.
