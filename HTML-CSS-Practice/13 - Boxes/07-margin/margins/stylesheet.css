    /*
        The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly
        given in pixels, although you can also use percentages and ems.

        If one box sits on top of another, margins are collapsed, which means the
        larger of the two margins will be used and the smaller will be disregarded.

        NOTE: If the width of a box is specified then the margin is added to the width
        of the box.

        You can specify the values for each side of a box using:

            margin-top:
            margin-right:
            margin-bottom:
            margin-left:

        You can also use shorthand (where the values are in clockwise order:

            margin: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>

        Lastly, you can also use another short hand form:

            margin: <top and bottom> <left and right>

        The value of the margin property is not inherited by child elements in the
        same way that the color value of the font-family property is, so you need to
        specify the margin for every element that needs to use it.
