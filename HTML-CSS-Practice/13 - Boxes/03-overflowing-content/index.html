        She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the
        first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything
        she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she
        had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't
        the most important. It was the next step that was the most important.

        Greg understood that this situation would make Michael terribly uncomfortable.
        Michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though Greg could
        prevent it from happening, he opted to let it happen. It was quite ironic,
        really. It was something Greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million
        times, yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends.
        He rationalized that it would ultimately make Michael a better person and that
        no matter how uncomfortable, everyone should experience racism at least once
        in their lifetime.

        She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think
        back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment
        when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once.
        She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness,
        and pride all running through her at the same time.
