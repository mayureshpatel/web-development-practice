        The display property allows you to tturn an inline element
        into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used
        to hide an element from the page.

        The values this property can take are:

            inline: causes a block-level element to act like an inline element
            block: causes an inline element to act like a block-level element
            inline-block: causes a block-level element to flow like an inline
                element, while retaining other features of a block-level element
            none: hides an element from the page. In this case, the element acts
                as thought it is not on the page at all.

        If you use this property, it it important to note that inline boxes are
        not supposed to create block-level elements.
