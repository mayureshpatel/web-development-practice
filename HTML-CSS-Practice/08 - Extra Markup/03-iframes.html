    <!--
        An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page - and
        in that window you can see another page.

            iframe = inline frame

        One common use of iframes is to embed a Google Map into a page. The content
        of the iframe can be any html page.

        An iframe is created using the <iframe> element. These are a few attributes
        that you will need to know to use it:

            src: specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame
            height: specifies the height of the iframe in pixels
            width: specifies the width of the iframe in pixels
            scrolling: (not supported in HTML5) indicates whether an iframe should
                have scroll bars or not
            frameborder: (not supported in HTML5) indicates whether the frame should
                have a border or not
            seamless: can be added to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired; does
                not need a value, but some authors will give it a value of seamless
