        The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information
        about that web page.

        It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling
        search engines about yoru page, who created it, and whether or not it is time
        sensitive.

        The <meta> element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It
        uses attributes to carry the information.

        The most common attributes are the name and content attributes, which tend to be
        used together. These attributes specify properties of the entire page. The value
        of the name attribute is the property you are setting, and the value of the
        content attribute is the value that you want to give to this property.

        Some values for the name property:

            description: contains the description of the page. commonly used by search
                engines to understand what the page is about and should be a maximum
                of 155 characters. can also be displayed in search results.

            keywords: contains a list of comma-separated words that a user might serach
                on to find the page. in practice, this no longer has any noticable effect
                on how search engines index your page.

            robots: indicates whether search engines should add this page to their search
                results or not. a value of noindex can be used if this page should not
                be added. a value of nofollow can be used if search engines should add
                this page in their results but not any pages that it links to.

            http-equiv: provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content
                attribute.

                author: defines the author of the web page

                pragma: prevents the browser from caching the page. (storing it locally
                    to save time downloading it on subsequent visits)

                expires: can be used to indicate when the page should expire (and no
                    longer be cached). note, date should be formatted -> WD DD MMM YYY hh:mm:ss timezone
