        The border-spacing property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells.
        By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table cell.

        The value of this property is usually specified in pixels. You can specify two values
        if desired to specify separate numbers for horizontal and vertical spacing.

            border-spacing: <vertical-spacing> <horizontal-spacing>

        When a border has been used on table cells, where two cells meet, the width of lines
        would be twice that of the outside edges. You can collapse adjacent borders to prevent
        this using the border-collapse property.

        This property colapses borders into one single border where possible. (border-spacing
        will be ignored and cells pushed together, and empty-cells properties will be ignored).

        This property can have two values:

            collapse: collapses borders
            separate: separates borders (border-spacing and empty-cells will be obeyed)
