/*
    Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-style-position
    property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the
    outside of the box containing the main points.

    This property can take one of two values:

        outside: marker sits to the left of the block of text (default behavior)
        inside: marker sits inside the box of text (which is indented)
