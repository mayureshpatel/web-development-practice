    <h1>HTML Videos</h1>

    <!--
        You can add videos to your web pages using the <video> element.

        The <video> element has a number of attributes which allow you to
        control video playback:

            src: specifies the path to the video
            poster: allows you to specify an image to show while the video
                is downloading or until the user tells the video to play
            width: specifies the width of the video
            height: specifies the height of the video
            controls: indicates that the browser should supply its own controls
                for playback
            autoplay: specifies that the file should play automatically
            loop: indicates that the video should start playing again once
                it has ended
            preload: tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It
                can have one of three values:

                    none: the browser should not load the video until the
                        user presses play

                    auto: the browser should download the video when the page
                        loads

                    metadata: the browser should just collect information such
                        as the size, first frame, track list, and duration
