/*
    You can specify different values for the first letter or first line of text inside
    an element using

        :first-letter
        :first-line

    Technically, these are not properties. They are known as pseudo-elements.

    You specify the pseudo-element at the end of the selector, and then specify
    the declarations as you would normally for any other element.

    NOTE: 
        CSS introduces both pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. A pseudo-element
        acts like an extra element in the code. In the case of the :first-letter and
        :first-line pseudo elements, it is as if there is an extra element around
        the first letter or the first line which can have its own styles applied.
