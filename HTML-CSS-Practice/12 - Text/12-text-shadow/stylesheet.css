/*
    The text-shadow property is sued to create a drop shadow, which is a dark version
    of the word just behind it and slightly offset. It can also be used to create an
    embossed effect by adding a shadow that is slightly lighter than the text.

    The value of this property is quite complicated because it can take three lengths
    and a color for the drop shadow.

    Values:

        The first value indicates how far to the left or right the shadow should fall.

        The second value indicates the distance to the top or bottom that the shadow
        should fall.

        The third value is optional and specifes the amount of blur that should be applied
        to the drop shadow.

        The fourth value is the color of the drop shadow.
