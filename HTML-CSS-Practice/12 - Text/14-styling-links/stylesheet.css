/*
    Browsers tend to show links in blue with an underline by default, and they
    will change the color of links that have been visited to help users know
    which pages they have been to.

    In CSS, there are two pseudo-elements that allow you to set different styles
    for links that have and have not yet been visited.

        :link - allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited
        :visited - allows you to set styles for linked that have been clicked on
