/*
    The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text. The property
    can take one of four values:

        left: indicates that the text should be left-aligned
        right: indidcates that the test should be right-aligned
        center: indicates that the test should be center-aligned
        justify: indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the
            last line, should be set to take up the full width of the
            containing box

    Note: Justified text looks at the words on each individual line and creates an equal gap between
    those words. It can look odd if you end up with large gaps between some words and smaller gaps
    between others.
