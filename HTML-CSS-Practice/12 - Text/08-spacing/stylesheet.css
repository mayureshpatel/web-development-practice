/*
    Kerning is the term typographers use for the space between each letter. You can control the space
    between each letter with the letter-spacing property.

    It is particularly helpful to increase the kerning when your heading or sentence is all in uppercase.
    If your text is in sentence case, increasing or decreasing the kerning can make it harder to read.

    You can also control the gap between words using the word-spacing property.

    When you specify a value for these properties, it should be given in ems, and it will be added
    on top of the default value specified by the font.

    The default gap between words is set by the typeface (often around 0.25em), and it is unlikely
    that you would need to change this property regularly. If the typeface is bold or you have increased
    the space between letters, then a larger gap between words can increase readability.
